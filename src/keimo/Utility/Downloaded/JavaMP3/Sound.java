/**
 * A sound object, that represents an input stream of uncompressed PCM sound data samples, decoded from encoded MPEG data.
 * <p>
 * To create a sound object from encoded MPEG data (MP1/MP2/MP3), simply use {@link #Sound(InputStream)}. The decoding process will be done as data is read from this stream. You may also, as a convenience, write all the (remaining) decoded data into an {@link OutputStream} using {@link #decodeFullyInto(OutputStream)}.
 * <p>
 * You may use the several metadata functions such as {@link #getSamplingFrequency()} to get data about the sound. You may use {@link #getAudioFormat()} to get the sound audio format, to be used with the {@link javax.sound.sampled} API.
 *
 * See the project README (on Github) for some context and various examples on how to use the library.

  /**
   * Creates a new Sound, that will read from the specified encoded MPEG data stream.
   * <p>
   * This method will try to read the very beginning of the MPEG stream (i.e. 1 MPEG frame) to get its sampling frequency and various other metadata. <b>A stream containing no MPEG data frames/a zero duration MPEG data source will be considered as invalid and will throw {@link IOException}.</b>
   * <p>
   * This method will not read or decode the file fully, which means it doesn't block and is very fast (as opposed to {@link #decodeFullyInto(OutputStream)}; you probably don't need to execute this method in a specific background thread.
   * <p>It is only when reading from this stream that the decoding process will take place (as you read from the stream). <b>The decoding process is quite CPU-intensive, though, so you are encouraged to use a background thread/other multithreading techniques to read from the stream without blocking the whole application.</b>
   * <p>
   * The various metadata methods such as {@link #getSamplingFrequency()} and {@link #isStereo()} may be called as soon as this object is instantiated (i.e. may be called at any time during the object lifetime).
   * <p>
   * <b>The data layout is as follows (this is a contract that won't change):</b>
   * <br>The decoded PCM sound data is stored as a contiguous stream of 16-bit little-endian signed samples (2 bytes per sample).
   * <ul>
   * <li>If the sound is in stereo mode, then the samples will be interleaved, e.g. {@code left_sample_0 (2 bytes), right_sample_0 (2 bytes), left_sample_1 (2 bytes), right_sample_1 (2 bytes), ...}
   * <li>If the sound is in mono mode, then the samples will be contiguous, e.g. {@code sample_0 (2 bytes), sample_1 (2 bytes), ...}
   * </ul>
   * @param in The input stream from which to read the encoded MPEG data, must be non-null.
   * @throws IOException If an {@link IOException} is thrown when reading the underlying stream, or if there's an unexpected EOF during an MPEG frame, or if there's an error while decoding the MPEG data, e.g. if there's no MPEG data in the specified stream.
